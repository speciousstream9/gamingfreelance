    <p>We are always interested in new members joining. There are no requirements, other than being a real person, and ideally, interested in tech. We have many channels devoted to multiple subjects, from design and development of tech, to conferences and
        diversity. We are building a sustainable, diverse community of people who are interested in growing their skills, experience, community and industry.

<h1 id="a-few-things-to-note">A few things to note:</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The GamingFreelance is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, work, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or have membership revoked at the discretion of the organizers.
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GamingFreelance is not a substitute for legal advice from a professional lawyer/barrister.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GamingFreelance should be considered SFW (Safe for Work). As a rule of thumb, before you post anything, consider if you’d want a co-worker or your boss to see it. While the admins are aware that GamingFreelance is used by both professionals and vistors alike the tone shall be kept as SFW and to be used in a Social capacity until the community decides otherwise.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-following-is-not-allowed">The following is not allowed:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Any content which is not in keeping with the Code of Conduct</li>
  <li>Blatantly sexual content <em>(pornography, nudity, etc.)</em></li>
  <li>Misogyny, ableism, sexism, racism, nationalist insults, etc.</li>
  <li>Defamation, personal abuse or any other type of abuse, harassment, stalking, threatening content or any content that would otherwise violate the rights of others</li>
  <li>Links to anything which would break the rules if posted directly</li>
  <li>Misdirection or deceiving links <em>(such as to sites which hijack the browser, rickroll, etc.)</em></li>
  <li>Anything illegal</li>
  <li>Posting any private phone numbers, or any personal contact information with explicit prior authorisation of that person</li>
  <li>Advocating criminality or violence</li>
  <li>Trolling <em>(A ‘troll’ is someone who posts controversial, inflammatory or off-topic messages with the primary intent of provoking other users. These users should be reported to admins immediately.)</em></li>
  <li>Posting libellous material</li>
  <li>Identifying or speculating as to the identity of any pseudonymous user. <em>(The exception to this being admins, where necessary for the safe moderation and administration of the community.)</em></li>
  <li>Soliciting passwords or personally identifying information for commercial or unlawful purposes</li>
  <li>Posting content in respect of any matter that is currently before the courts</li>
  <li>Posting spam of any description</li>
  <li>Posting or soliciting any members, including inviting members to use a service, sign up for anything, subscribe, or join any events or similar </li>
  <li>Posting “affiliate links” <em>(where someone clicking the link can result in a reward)</em> in any channel</li>
  <li>Link dumping, or posting links unrelated to the conversation without comment. Discussion comes from differing view points. If you’re posting a link, please comment on why you’re posting it, or what you find interesting about it. Use common sense when posting links, and ask in #admin if you’re unsure.</li>
  <li>Posting URL shortened links, such as those from bit.ly, tinyurl, etc - as we cannot confirm that these links are safe. Please post the full expanded link instead</li>
  <li>Posting or soliciting any members to contribute to or take part in any survey</li>
  <li>Ignoring requests by admins or moderators to cooperate</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="harassment">Harassment</h1>

<p>Previously our rules stated that any breaches of the Terms of Service could be handled in any way that was fit by the admins. This could be either doing nothing about any alleged harassment or people could get banned. This lead to situations that ended up falling through the net and those issues always end up having their own sets of ramifications.</p>

<p>These new changes that we’ll be implementing are in effort to correct these instances and to avoid them happening ever again.</p>

<h1 id="strikes">Strikes</h1>

<p>GamingFreelance will now work on a 3 strike system. All incidents will be recorded and the Admins will be keeping an up to date tally of people who are breaking ToS or generally having a negative attitude.</p>

<p>An example of this;
Anything that is blatant - linking to porn or NSFW material is a strike without question
Harassment - is a strike
Negative Attitudes - will be handled differently an example of this could be young people who needed to be guided into doing better. This will be handed by a DM with an admin who will approach the person in an attempt to guide. Should these words be unheeded a secondary strike will be applied.</p>

<p>The team understands that not all strikes are equal; or there could be ways of reasoning out poor behaviour (being provoked etc) however, in an environment where you are expected to reason like adults. It’s something we’re no longer excusing.</p>

<p>So, unfortunately, if this shoe fits then this is something to be aware of.</p>

<h1 id="in-channel-harassment">In Channel Harassment:</h1>

<p>On the terms of in channel harassment. Once again, approaching this in a fashion where we are all human beings who are worthy of respect and being treated civilly. That is what we will ultimately strive for. For the sake of consistency I’ll reiterate the general house rules.</p>

<h1 id="house-rules">House Rules:</h1>

<p>In all things we ask you to <strong>FOCUS</strong>.</p>

<p>Is it…</p>

<p>Friendly
On Topic
Clean
Useful
Safe</p>

<p>And if what you’re saying isn’t any of the above then you probably shouldn’t say it.</p>

<h1 id="dm-harassment">DM Harassment</h1>

<p>With DM Harassment we want to change the approach entirely.</p>

<p>For any and all DM harassment where it can’t be seen, we would like those who are being subjected to harassment to start a chat with both the person who they feel is harassing them and an admin. This way both parties can copy paste logs of the conversation to that particular chat - and wait for an admin to response.</p>

<p>We wave the right of the potential accused to not allow a chat log to be shared in this instance, as its the teams feeling that if you have nothing to hide then its discussion shouldn’t be an issue.</p>

<p>As it protects all parties on all sides - it prevents people cutting and chopping of chat logs or of any context to sentences that could be lost.</p>

<p>The admin in that instance will then work with the parties involved to come to a resolution on the subject. If harassment has been found it will be a strike and the offending party will be barred from communicating with that specific person. Should they reoffend it will be an instant ban.</p>

<p>For where they have been any misunderstandings happening the admin will help to resolve any miscommunications.</p>

<p>For those who are making claims about someone harassing them where they have not equal measures shall take place. Ie. they will be barred from communicating with that person and will be giving a strike. Breaking of this shall be an instant ban.</p>

<h1 id="being-asked-to-leave">Being Asked to Leave</h1>

<p>There may come a point in time where a member of the community may be significantly impacting another members life either personally or professionally. So, things like abusing people on Twitter or there being a conflict of interest between members may result in you being asked to leave.</p>

<p>We want ITC to be a safe and constructive space for everyone to be in. As the internet is a vibrant and expansive place there are plenty of other places for you to go to if you wish to engage in shitty behaviour.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Admins will have the say as to who stays and who goes. As the old saying goes; this is our bar and we decide who comes and goes. It’s the only way of providing some safeguards for people who have been less than honourable in their behaviours or conduct.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, people would act with honour and integrity to each other and generally just be kind. If you are incapable of doing that to each other. Then this is not a place for you and you will be asked to leave. The admins are under no obligation to elaborate on questions as to why certain members are gone. There has to be a level of trust that we are doing things with people’s best interests in mind, and if that trust isn’t there then this may apply to you too.</p>

<h1 id="concerning-accounts--slack-features">Concerning Accounts &amp; Slack Features</h1>

<ul>
  <li>A person should have one account, and each account should be one person. We do not allow company names, or accounts to join the channel. For example 1; you can be a part of company X but you are here to be a part of the community as an indiviual. Example 2 :if you have a company called “foobar inc” and you join as “foobar” then that’s a company name and that’s against the CoC. Please avoid putting your company name in as part of your username.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="you-may-not-join-if">You may not join if:</h1>

<ul>
  <li>You are currently banned for any reason.</li>
  <li>You are joining solely to spam.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-you-agree-to-by-joining">What you agree to by joining:</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Act responsibly.</li>
  <li>Treat others with respect.</li>
  <li>Abide by the rules.</li>
  <li>@here @channel @everyone are turned off so people don’t get unwanted notifications, and to avoid abuse of the feature.</li>
</ul>

d serious by the team, and will be dealt with. If repeated incidents of this happen where we are repeatedly warning people, we will consider the possiblty of shutting down the channel perminantly - with a view that there are many other places on the internet to discuss politics.</p>
